## Struggles
My biggest struggle for this assignment was MySQL, although i was more prepared for it this time around after the employee tracker assignment. It was still just really difficult to get my bearings. since this assignment had starter code i decided to write it all down instead of just copy pasting it. It actually helped alot more than i thought it would, it helped me understand more of what the starter code was really doing and what my objective for the assignment really was.
